Calculator
# IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU MUST USE THE STARTER CODE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. DO NOT GO FIND A TUTORIAL AND BUILD OUT SOME RANDOM CALCULATOR.

Project Standards:

  Students will use click events to capture user input.
  Students will use variables to store information needed by their application and keep track of their programâ€™s state.
  Students will use conditionals to control project flow.


# Project Task

You will be building a simple calculator in the browser. It should be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Your program should do the following:

1. Display a standard calculator to the user (you have starter files to help you with this).
2. You will need to make references to all the proper HTML elements you'll be using to display elements to the user.
3. You should make variables to keep track of the 1st number, operator, 2nd number, and the result of the math.
4. When a user clicks on a button it should work like a standard calculator. 
  a. Every number they click should be captured and build the 1st number until they click an operator (Ex. If they click 1 and 8, your program should display 18 to them)
  b. Clicking an operator (+, -, x, =) should only work if they have clicked numbers first.
  c. A user can only fill out the 2nd number once they have filled out the 1st number and clicked an operator.
  d. The = key will only work if a user has clicked both a 1st number, an operator, and a 2nd number. When they have filled in all the necessary inputs, = will display the proper  number to them (Ex. if they input 5, +, and 7, they should be displayed 12).
5. The clear button will clear all prior input and allow the user to start over.
6. Your JavaScript code will form the conditional logic to determine whether a clicked button should work or not.
7. You should display the 1st number, the operator, the 2nd number, and the math output (sum, product, difference, quotient) to the user at the appropriate times.
